This is a journaller and dejournaller written in java for the Lightweight event system.

You will need to install maven 2.x in order to build:

% mvn clean package

NOTE: To stop this journaller, you can't just control-c it or kill -9 it. If you do that, the
Java shutdown hook may not catch the signal and the file won't get closed properly. Use the
lwes-journaller-stop script or use kill -15.
