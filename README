This is a journaller and dejournaller written in java for the Lightweight event system.

You will need to install maven 2.x in order to build:

% mvn clean package

To create the distribution package:

% mvn assembly:assembly

Running

To start the journaller:
% bin/lwes-journaller -m <multicast_addr> -p <multicast_port> -f <filename>

To stop the journaller:
NOTE: To stop this journaller, you can't just control-c it or kill -9 it. If you do that, the
Java shutdown hook may not catch the signal and the file won't get closed properly. Use the
lwes-journaller-stop script or use kill -15.

% bin/lwes-journaller-stop

To tell the journaller to rotate the log file (you will probably want a cron job for this):

% bin/lwes-rotate-log -m <multicast_addr> -p <multicast_port>
